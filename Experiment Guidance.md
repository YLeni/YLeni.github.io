## Presenting Visualization

### 1. Overview

In this experiment, you would be given **a material that introduces a data visualization including its visual encoding and some findings in the visualization and a guideline on how to present a visualization**. Then according to the material and the guideline, you would **record a slide show with audio of your voice to present the visualization**.  If you using PPT to record the slide show you can upload the PPT file with recorded audio inserted on the slides, otherwise, you would upload a video file. We also provide a guideline on how to record the slide show.

#### Content of the presentation:

- **Introduction** | Briefly introduce what information/topic the visualization presents.

- **Explaining the visual encoding ** 

- **Findings**

#### Templates:

- <a href=".\pre-exp-file\Name-SID.pptx">Click to download the PPT template</a>


#### Requirements

- The length of the slide show should be **less than 3 minutes**
- Use your own words
- Try to utilize the presentation guideline 

### 2. The visualization to be presented

You have most 15 minutes to read and understand the visualization, including its visual encoding and some findings it shows. 

#### 2.1 Introduction

We introduce the Influence Flower as a new visual metaphor for the influence relations between researchers. An Influence Flower is an visualization with the target researcher in the center and other related researchers on a circular arc. It visualizes how a researcher influences and is influenced by other researchers. The influence of researcher A has to researcher B is measured by the number of researcher B’ papers that cited researcher A’s papers.

#### 2.2 Visual Encoding

    <div style="padding: 2px;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Figure1:</span> The Influence Flower of Ben Shneiderman, who conducted fundamental research in the field of human-computer interaction</div>
</center>

**Edge**. The color and arrowhead of an edge indicate the influence’s direction. We assign two contrasting colors, red to denote the influence that the center node has towards the outer nodes and blue to represent the influence that the outer nodes have towards the center node. The thickness of the edge denotes the strength of influence. 

**Node**. The center node is white. The color of an outer node signifies the difference between the observed researcher and the other researcher's influence towards each other, from dark blue ( outer node has more influence) to white (the center and outer node’ influence is equal) to dark red ( the center node has more influence). The size of a node is proportional to the sum of influence.

    <img width = "600" src=".\pre-exp-file\contrast flower1-1.png"><img width = "600" src=".\pre-exp-file\contrast flower2-1.png">    
    <br>  
<div style="padding: 2px;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Figure2:</span> Comparing Influence Flower of Ben Shneiderman in three time periods. Top: 1971 to 1999. Bottom: 2000 to 2009. Grey background: anchor flower from 1971 to 2018.</div>
</center>

**Contrast Flower.** To compare multiple influence flowers generated at different time periods, we created the concept of an anchor flower. The anchor flower and influence flowers share the same nodes. The time period of the anchor is always the superset of all influence flowers – here the entire time range. The anchor is greyed out in the background, and an influence flower is drawn in color on top of the anchor flower.

#### 2.3 Findings

 <center class = "half">   
    <img width = "600" src=".\pre-exp-file\contrast flower1-1.png"><img width = "600" src=".\pre-exp-file\contrast flower2-1.png">    
    <br>  
<div style="padding: 2px;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Figure2:</span> Comparing Influence Flower of Ben Shneiderman in three time periods. Top: 1971 to 1999. Bottom: 2000 to 2009. Grey background: anchor flower from 1971 to 2018.</div>
</center>

**Fig. 2** compares two Influence Flowers of Ben Shneiderman. The time range of the anchor flower is from 1971 to 2018, greyed out as a background. The time range of the top flower is 1971 to 1999, and the time range of the bottom flower is from 2000 to 2009. **Catherine is the largest node in both flowers.** For Shneiderman, **Catherine bore more outgoing influence before 2000 (red), the influence almost equalized in the 2000s (white)**. One may also notice **Niklas, whose mutual influence with Shneiderman was non-existent before 1999, began in the 2000s.** This is corroborated by career information obtained from Niklas’s homepage – that his first paper was published after 1999, he started his faculty career between 2000 and 2009.

### 4. Presentation guideline

#### 4.1 When explaining the visual encoding

- Guide audiences' attention
- Give concrete examples to make your explanation more clear. You can say something like “in this bar chart each bar presents…, for instance, this bar is…”.
- Add text labels or legend to the slides to help explain the visual encoding

#### 4.2 When tell the findings

- Make sure the audience 
- Explicitly tell what visual clues 

- If necessary, you can explain the visual encoding again to explain visual patterns

### 5. Record the slide show
Here is the instruction of how to record the slide show. Different from the top vis competition, you don't have to export the video, you can directly upload the slide show file with the narration, unless you use the screen recording software. 
Go to the section according to the recording tool you plan to use.

- PowerPoint - Windows (recommend, you can modify the recording of a specific slide)
- PowerPoint - Mac (recommend, you can modify the recording of a specific slide)
- Keynote
- Screen recording software (If the recording function of Keynote or PPT fails)

#### 5.1  PowerPoint - Windows
